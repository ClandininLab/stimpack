Customizing Labpack
==================

The labpack directory has four important components that give you complete control over the `stimpack` framework. 


- `labpack/labpack` 
        contains files that override the same files found in `stimpack` source code
- `labpack/configs`
        contains files that override the same files found in `stimpack` configs
- `labpack/server` 
        contains files that override the same files found in `stimpack` server
- `labpack/presets` 
        contains files that override the same files found in `stimpack` presets

You can explore how these may be used to customize `stimpack` by reading the following documentation
