# stimpack.experiment
**stimpack.experiment** is a python package for experimental acquisition and metadata handling in visual neuroscience experiments. It is designed to act as a relatively stable core package which can run on its own with very limited, demonstrative functionality. Functionality can be greatly expanded by using a lab or user-specific package, which should be maintained as a separate repository. Check out the wiki for instructions on how to build your own lab or user-specific package, and how to configure stimpack.experiment for your use.

## Getting started

The easiest entry point to explore stimpack.experiment and test it out is to run the gui

`python gui.py`

When you first run stimpack.experiment, before configuring it, the experimental control window will pop up alongside a small stimulus presentation screen.

This includes very limited animal metadata options and only a couple very basic visual stimulus protocols, and stimuli are rendered into that small display window. To configure and extend stimpack.experiment, check out the [wiki](https://github.com/ClandininLab/stimpack.experiment/wiki).
