# StimPack
Suite for experiments involving various types of stimuli, such as visual and optogenetic.

## Getting started

Install using `pip install -e .`

Then start the experiment GUI with `stimpack` in command line.

When you first run stimpack, before configuring it, the experimental control window will pop up alongside a small stimulus presentation screen.

This includes very limited animal metadata options and only a couple very basic visual stimulus protocols, and stimuli are rendered into that small display window. To configure and extend stimpack, check out the [wiki](https://github.com/ClandininLab/stimpack/wiki).
